ABOUT THE CODE
This code is for a 3D Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics solver. It is a cell centered, structured solver, using mulit-block structured grids in Plot3D format. It uses explicit and implicit time integration methods. It uses MUSCL extrapolation to reconstruct the conserved variables from the cell centers to the cell faces. The code uses the Roe flux difference splitting scheme for the inviscid fluxes, and a central scheme for the viscous fluxes. It is second order accurate in both space and time.

CURRENT STATUS
The code is 2nd order accurate in space and time using the explicit solver. Available explicit time integration methods are forward euler (1st order) and a minimum storage four stage Runge-Kutta method (2nd order). The implicit solver (LU-SGS) is implemented for implicit time integration. Dual time stepping is implemented for time accuracy in the implicit solver. Available implicit time integrations methods come from the Beam and Warming family of methods and are the implicit euler (1st order), Crank-Nicholson (2nd order), and BDF2 (2nd order) methods. The code has been thoroughly commented. Currently the code is somewhat parallel. It assumes that you will run the code with the same number of processors as there are blocks in the grid.

TO DO LIST
- Parallelize more robustly.
- Add RANS terms with turbulence model.

FILES AND CLASSES
